                    <li>I was born and raised in Poland for the first 7 years of my life before my parents decided to move to Ireland, in pursuit of a better life. I found it hard at first adjusting to the English language and trying to learn it. I was the opposite of how people say that kids pick up languages fast.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I attend St.Paul's Community College. I was and still I'm a very inquisitive person. While studying there I was looking at some of the opportunities that would be available for me moving forward. All which led to going to SETU( back then know as WIT) </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I decided to take a break from studying after my Leaving Cert and focus a bit more and what it was that I actually would like to do. During that time I have learned a lot about myself and what it is that I would like to do with my career. Aswell as that I decided to travel and see a little bit of the world before going back to education </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I decided to enroll in SSD in SETU as it was close to home and offered a great mix between theory and practical work. I also feel like SETU does a good job at trying to help students land their first job after University </li>
